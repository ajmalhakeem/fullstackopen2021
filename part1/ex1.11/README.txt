ok i think i messed up the App.js a bit in the previous exercises. so what i did was instead of copying the most recent App.js into the exercise directories i've just copied the previous App.js from the previos exercise. 
Which means that for like 3-4 exercises now they're probably all the same. 
oh well. sorry if you are marking this i guess you'll have to go through the commits. 
at least i did the commits though!
won't make that mistake again.
maybe i can make a script that does this for me.
